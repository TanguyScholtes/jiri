# Jiri

## What is Jiri ?
Jiri is a Laravel application designed to help organize a jury held by professionnals for the finals of the Design Web and Projets Web courses in Computer Graphics Design at the Haute École de la Province de Liège (Belgium). The app was tailored to suit the wills and needs of teachers and professionnals for these specific courses.

## Prerequisites
Being a Laravel application, Jiri obviously needs a Laravel installation to run.
